# First, you'll need to initialize the weights. We want these to be small such 
# that the input to the sigmoid is in the linear region near 0 and not squashed 
# at the high and low ends. It's also important to initialize them randomly so that 
# they all have different starting values and diverge, breaking symmetry. So, 
# we'll initialize the weights from a normal distribution centered at 0. A good 
# value for the scale is 1/âˆšn where n is the number of input units. This keeps 
# the input to the sigmoid low for increasing numbers of input units.

#     calculate the error gradient in the output unit: error_grad = (y-y_hat)*f'(h)*x
#     update the weights: w = w + learningrate * delta_w/m (m is the numb of records so that we can reduce large 
#         variations in the training data)
