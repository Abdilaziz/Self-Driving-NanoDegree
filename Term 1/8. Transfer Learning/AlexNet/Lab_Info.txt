We will take an implementation of AlexNet's Architecture with
the weights provided by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center, and use
transfer learning to implement it with the German Traffic Sign Recognition Training Data

AlexNet was originally trained on the ImageNet Database and took about a week of training time to complete.
